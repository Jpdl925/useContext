summary: To Share state with UseContext.

Lift the state up to the closest parent
Create a Context (like a moving truck transporting data)
Wrap our component tree with using a provider component(we can share anything) we want to share state
Once we do this we can access the share state using UseContext in the component we want to access the state.
